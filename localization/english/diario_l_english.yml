 je_deuda_esp: "Debt Situation"
je_deuda_esp_reason: "In the 1830s, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] experienced a complex economic and financial situation marked by political instability, institutional weakness, and accumulating debts.\n\nDuring this period, the Spanish public [Concept('concept_credit', '$concept_credit_debt$')|l] became a significant issue affecting both the national economy and the country's international credit reputation.\n\nFinancial administration was chaotic, and the lack of political stability hindered the implementation of coherent fiscal policies, contributing to the increase in [Concept('concept_credit', '$concept_credit_debt$')|l].\n\nDebt often exceeded the government's capacity to pay interest and reduce the principal. This led to a cycle of successive loans to pay off previous debts, further worsening the [Concept('concept_credit', '$concept_credit_debt$')|l] situation."

je_infraestructura_esp: "Railway Communication Network"
je_infraestructura_esp_reason: "The lack of a railway network in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in the 1830s was a significant factor contributing to the delay in the industrialization and economic development of the country. The absence of an efficient railway system limited the mobility of goods and people, hindering trade and industrialization, and negatively impacting the economy and progress of the country at that time."

je_falta_capital_esp: "Lack of Capital"
je_falta_capital_esp_reason: "The lack of capital is a significant factor hindering economic development and investment. The shortage of financial resources limits the country's ability to undertake infrastructure and industrial development projects. This is due to a combination of factors, such as public debt accumulated from previous conflicts, dependence on a predominantly agrarian economy, and the lack of confidence from both national and foreign investors in the Spanish economy at that time.\n\nThis lack of capital has a negative impact on investment in key sectors such as industrial modernization and the promotion of economic growth.\n\n#bold We can also refocus our economy towards a more agricultural one by passing the [GetLawType('law_agrarianism').GetName] law, gradually moving away from dependence on $capitalists$.#!\n\n#bold If we abandon the capitalist system by passing certain #tooltippable;tooltip:anti-capitalism_laws_tooltip economic laws#!, capital will cease to be a problem.#!"

In an attempt to capitalize on them, [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_intelligentsia',GetPlayer).GetLeader.GetLastName] published a manifesto questioning the authority of Count Toreno, #bold José María Queipo de Llano#!, eventually leading to [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_intelligentsia',GetPlayer).GetLeader.GetLastName] assuming the presidency of the government on September 14, accompanied by only two ministers."

je_motin_la_granja_esp: "The Sargentada"
je_motin_la_granja_esp_reason: "The unease felt in the Royal Palace of Segovia was but a reflection of the agitation occurring outside.
